the objective for this project is to create a way of building websites
without having to use multiple tools and programming languages, just C++.

this project will be split into classes.

Here is a rough outline of how the server will work.

	// setup an actual file descriptor
	socket()
	bind()
	listen()

	// accept clients
	accept() // run in a loop and give the new file descriptor to a function

	read()
	parse
	determine program flow
	form a response, or terminate connection or call read() again.
	write()
	close() or go to the read step again.
	
Everything done in between read and write will be up to the actual
web designers. That is where they will have the website features.

Everything described above, except for determining program flow and
forming a response can be integrated as a standard portion of the project.

It will be up to the website designers to learn how the standard features
are used, which should be made easy due to good quality documentation.
