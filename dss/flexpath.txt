essentially, all of the tcp things occur,
the client message is received into a buffer.

The format for buffers in this program is called
metabuf. The struct looks like this.
struct metabuf
{
    void * start;
    long length;
};

Some tcp stuff happens, then step() is called,
then step receives a message from a client, thenthe message is sent 
to httpmap() where its http heades get mapped out.

The mapped out headers get passed to flowpath() where a series
of conditions get checked, and based on those conditions, a feature
will happen.
